A very basic web application demo for controlling rwchcd

This web app uses a configuration file named "cfg.json", expected in the same
directory, and containing a single JSON object with any of the following items:

{
  "dhwts": [0, 1, ...],
  "dhwtrunmodes": [[1, "System"], [2, "Comfort"], [3, "Eco"], [4, "Frost-Free"]],
  "hcircuits": [0, 1, ...],
  "hcircrunmodes": [[1, "System"], [2, "Comfort"], [3, "Eco"], [4, "Frost-Free"]],
  "modes": [[1, "Off"], [2, "Auto"], [130, "Auto no DHW"], [3, "Comfort"], [4, "Eco"], [5, "Frost-Free"], [6, "DHW Only"]],
  "graphurl": "url",
  "homeurl:" "url",
  "temperatures": [0, 1, ...],
  "toutdoor": N,
  "tindoor": N,
  "webapptitle": "WebApp Name"
}

All items are optional

- "dhwts" is an array of valid DBus DHWT node ids, defining enables DHWT page
  with info and force charge option
- "dhwtrunmodes" enables per-DHWT runmode override, the format is an array
  of [runmode, "description"] tuples where valid runmodes are as defined in
  enum e_runmode. Options will be presented in the order listed.
  Only used if "dhwts" is defined.
- "hcircuits" is an array of valid DBus hcircuit node ids, defining enables
  heating circuit page with temperature offset adjustment
- "hcircrunmodes" enables per-circuit runmode override, the format is an array
  of [runmode, "description"] tuples where valid runmodes are as defined in
  enum e_runmode. Options will be presented in the order listed.
  Only used if "hcircuits" is defined.
- "modes" is an array of [sysmode, "description"] tuples where valid sysmodes
  are as defined in enum e_systemmode. Defining enables system mode control.
  Adding 128 to the value triggers Runtime.StopDhw. Options will be presented
  in the order listed.
- "graphurl" is an optional url to e.g. telemetry graphs
- "homeurl" enables a top level navbar link to some homepage
- "temperatures" is an array of valid DBus Temperatures node ids, defining
  enables TÂ° page showing names/values for all listed ids.
- "toutdoor" is the DBus temperature node id for the outdoor temperature
- "tindoor" is the DBus temperature node id for the indoor temperature
- "webapptitle" is the name of the web app, defining enables PWA integration

Available DBus nodes can be explored using e.g.
gdbus introspect --system --dest "org.slashdirt.rwchcd" --object-path "/org/slashdirt/rwchcd" --recurse
